# sentiment-analysis
This code can be used to do the sentiment analysis for any YouTube channel. I have utilized YouTube API in my code. For a particular channel, we will use the specific channel id in the code to see how the comments are. It will show the percentage of positive comments and negative comments through pie chart.
